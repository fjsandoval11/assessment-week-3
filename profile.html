            Freddy aspires to become a software engineer and gain the freedom and job security the role comes with. <br>
            When not overloading his brain at Devmountain he can be found playing video games, chilling with his dog and bunny, learning to play the guitar, making weird food experiments in the kitchen, and messing around with his drone.
